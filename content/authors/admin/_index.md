I am Varada Kolhatkar ([IPA:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) \[ʋəɾəda kɔːlɦəʈkər]). (If you are curious, Varada (वरदा) is a Sanskrit name, which means the one who grants your wishes 😇!) I grew up in a traditional household in a city called [Pune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune) in India. My first language is [Marathi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathi_language).

My background is in computer science and my areas of expertise are natural language processing, computational linguistics, and applied machine learning. I received my Ph.D. in computational linguistics from the [Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/compling/).

My heart is in teaching and learning and in 2018-19 academic year I was fortunate to get an opportunity to teach for [the Master of Data Science program](https://ubc-mds.github.io/about/) at the [The University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). Since then I've been teaching applied machine learning, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing related courses in the Department of Computer Science and [the Master of Data Science program](https://ubc-mds.github.io/about/). My job titles are Assistant Professor of Teaching and Option Co-Director of [the Master of Data Science Vancouver program](https://ubc-mds.github.io/about/). In simple language, I try to help students learn computer science and data science material and I also try to help run our Master of Data Science program smoothly.

In the past, I have spent time as a researcher in industry as well as in academia in different cities around the world, including Duluth, Baltimore, Toronto, Ottawa, Stuttgart, and Hamburg.
