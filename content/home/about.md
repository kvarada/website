My name is Varada Kolhatkar ([IPA:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) \[ʋəɾəda kɔːlɦəʈkər]). (If you are curious, Varada (वरदा) is a Sanskrit name, which means the one who grants your wishes😇!)

My background is in computer science and my areas of expertise are natural language processing, computational linguistics, and applied machine learning. I received my Ph.D. in computational linguistics from the [Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/compling/). 

My heart is in teaching and learning and I have been mainly focussing on it since October 2018. I teach applied machine learning, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing related courses in the Department of Computer Science and [the Master of Data Science program](https://ubc-mds.github.io/about/) at the [The University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). My job titles are Assistant Professor of Teaching in the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia and Option Co-Director of [the Master of Data Science Vancouver program](https://ubc-mds.github.io/about/). 

In my past life, I have worked as a researcher in industry as well as in academia in different countries, including Canada, the United States, Germany, and India.
