My name is Varada Kolhatkar ([IPA:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) \[ʋəɾəda kɔːlɦəʈkər]). (If you are curious, Varada (वरदा) is a Sanskrit name, which means the one who grants your wishes 😊!)

I am an Assistant Professor of Teaching in the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. I primarily teach machine learning, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing courses in the Department of Computer Science and [the Master of Data Science program](https://ubc-mds.github.io/about/). My background is in computer science and my areas of expertise are natural language processing, computational linguistics, and applied machine learning. I received my Ph.D. in computational linguistics from the [Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/compling/). I have worked in industry as well as in academia in different countries, including Canada, the United States, Germany, and India.
